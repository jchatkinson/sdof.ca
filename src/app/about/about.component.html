        <p class="mb-4">SDOF is a free tool to study the behavior of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems under various types of
            excitation. It can also be used to generate different excitation patterns and export them to a file.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Under the hood, the tool is using recurrence formulas to calculate the system response. The method is rather
            straightforward, and a detailed explanation is available in many structural analysis textbooks and online.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">SDOF was built using Angular 8.0 and tailwindCSS, and is hosted on Github.</p>
